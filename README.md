# Video Game Sales Forececasting

## What the Project Does

This project analyzes a dataset of historical global video game sales (1980â€“2016) to **identify and model the core factors that determine a game's success**. Specifically, it focuses on:

1.  **Data Preparation and Cleaning:** Handling missing values (including the unique 'TBD' case for user scores), correcting data types, and standardizing column names.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Determining the relevant time frame for forecasting, analyzing platform life cycles (appearance and decay), and identifying current market leaders.
3.  **Success Factor Modeling:** Investigating the correlation between game reviews (critic and user scores) and sales across different platforms.
4.  **Regional Market Profiling:** Creating detailed user profiles for North America (NA), Europe (EU), and Japan (JP), including top platforms, top genres, and the impact of **ESRB ratings** on sales in each region.
5.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Statistically testing two key hypotheses using T-tests:
      * Whether the average user ratings for the **Xbox One** and **PC** platforms are the same.
      * Whether the average user ratings for the **Action** and **Sports** genres are different.

The ultimate deliverable is a set of **data-backed recommendations for a 2017 advertising campaign**.

## Why the Project Is Useful

This project delivers essential **business intelligence** for the (fictitious) online store, Ice, addressing critical needs in marketing and strategy:

  * **Optimized Advertising ROI:** By identifying platforms and genres with the highest potential for success, the project ensures marketing dollars are spent efficiently on the most profitable segments for the upcoming year.
  * **Strategic Forecasting:** It establishes a methodology for determining the **relevant data period** for a forecast, a key step in any time-series analysis or forward-looking business plan.
  * **Geographic Customization:** The detailed regional profiles allow the marketing team to tailor advertising messages and game selection to specific cultural and demographic preferences, such as the distinct platform and genre dominance observed in the Japanese market.
  * **Risk Mitigation:** The analysis of review score correlation helps the company prioritize or deprioritize games based on review performance, reducing the risk of investing heavily in titles with low critical/user reception.
